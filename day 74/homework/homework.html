        <h1 class="h1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>were current, if not more so,
            in the company I joined.<br> I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1> <img class="img2"

        <p class="p1">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <h1 class="h1">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h1>

            <p class="p1"> I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
                for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <h1 class="h3"> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1> 
        <p class="p2">Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ”</p> </div>
